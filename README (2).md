# Intelligent Activity Detection Model for Mobile Fitness Application


This project aims to develop an intelligent activity detection model for a mobile fitness application using historical data gathered from various smartphone sensors. The dataset comprises low-level sensor data, which necessitates statistical feature extraction for effective utilization in machine learning algorithms. The project involves a thorough analysis, creation, implementation, and testing of the model to accurately identify user activities. Key programming concepts such as custom modules, function definitions, file processing, and exception handling are applied throughout the implementation. Additionally, tools like NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, and Scikit-learn are employed for scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning.

# Top Findings and Interpretation
The project involved training and evaluating three classifier models: Random Forest, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Each model was assessed using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The Random Forest Classifier emerged as the top performer with an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 99.999%, indicating its superior capability in identifying user activities from the dataset. The Decision Tree and KNN classifiers also showed high performance with scores exceeding 99.9%. The use of confusion matrices provided a comprehensive understanding of each modelâ€™s predictions. The findings suggest that while all three classifiers are effective, the Random Forest Classifier is recommended for its slightly better performance in this specific classification task. This model was saved using the joblib package, allowing for easy deployment and prediction without retraining, showcasing the practical applicability of the developed solution in real-world scenarios.
